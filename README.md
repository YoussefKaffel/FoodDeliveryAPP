#FoodDeliveryAPP using Android Studio 
=============================

This is a sample Android App that uses java and xml
with awesome user experience and interface.

## Building the Sample App

First, clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/YoussefKaffel/FoodDeliveryAPP.git`

Next, Open the file `app/src/main/res/values/keen.xml` and enter the project ID/read key/write key for your project, as well as your
collection name.

Building the sample then depends on your build tools.

### Android Studio (Recommended)

(These instructions were tested with Android Studio version 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.3, and 2.3.2)

* Open Android Studio and select `File->Open...` or from the Android Launcher select `Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)` and navigate to the root directory of your project.
* Select the directory or drill in and select the file `build.gradle` in the cloned repo.
* Click 'OK' to open the the project in Android Studio.
* A Gradle sync should start, but you can force a sync and build the 'app' module as needed.

### Gradle (command line)

* Build the APK: `./gradlew build`

### Eclipse

* Download the latest Android SDK from [Maven Central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/keen/keen-client-api-android)
  * Note: We publish both an AAR and a JAR; you may use whichever is more convenient based on your infrastructure and needs.


## Running the Sample App

Connect an Android device to your development machine.

### Android Studio

* Select `Run -> Run 'app'` (or `Debug 'app'`) from the menu bar
* Select the device you wish to run the app on and click 'OK'

### Gradle

* Install the debug APK on your device `./gradlew installDebug`
* Start the APK: `<path to Android SDK>/platform-tools/adb -d shell am start io.keen.client.android.example/io.keen.client.android.example.MyActivity`
